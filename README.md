``post_process_ogs5``

=================
This code is used to convert the gloabal solutions from binary files that are created by parallel output of OGS, and then creat VTK files for visualization.

The binary file of nodal solutiuons can be generated if ``$DAT_TYPE`` for domain output is BINRAY, e.g.
```
#OUTPUT
.
.
. 
 $GEO_TYPE
   DOMAIN 
 $DAT_TYPE
   BINRAY
 $TIM_TYPE
   STEPS 1
   
```
A number of binary files of nodal varariables are generated after a parallel computation. The files names take the form as
```
[input file name]_[process name]_domain_node_value_header.txt
[input file name]_[process name]_domain_variables.bin   
```

The number of the binary files is identical to the number of the PDEs solved in the computation.

The source code can be compiled by a simple command, e.g
```
g++ -o post-process -O3 post_process.cpp
```


The post-process is performed by using the compiled command with two arguments

```
./post-process [input file name]_[process name] [name of VTK file of mesh data with renumbered node indices]
```
or with one argument
```
./post-process [input file name]_[process name]
```
With the former, VTK files for visualization are created, with the later ASCII files are created according to the times that are specified in ``*.out`` file. For the second command, one need to use ``cat`` command to concatenate the corresponding vtk mesh file and the created files together for visualization. For example, assuming that the input file is ``foo``, the mesh is partitioned into 5 partitions, the process type for output is ``DEFORMATION``, and the new VTK mesh file  generated generated by partitioning is ``foo_renum_4.vtk``, a complete VTK file can be then obtained by running command
```
cat foo_renum_4.vtk  foo_DEFORMATION_[number].vtk > [new file name].vtk
```
